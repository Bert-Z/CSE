# Worse Is Better

### How to explain the idea to one of your friends whose major is not computer/software?



On the basis of the articles about "Worse Is Better", we can conclude the main idea of the philosophy as it is better to start a work with a minimal creation and finish some necessary part of it, then release it and let the work grow as needed.

For instance, when we have plenty of money to buy a house, choosing a semi-finished decoration house and then decorating by ourselves may stand in a higher proportion. We prefer to furnishing the living environment according to our habits and customs, but not arranged by others.



### Which contexts does "wore is better” suitable for? Which contexts doesn’t ? Please give at least two cases for each situation.



does:

- In software engineering's project. As developers, we cannot get all the demands at first and the product also need the feedback from users,  therefore we are supposed to finish a prototype and grow it as needed.
- VS Code and Virtual Studio. Virtual Studio is a nearly most completed compiler in c++, however many developers choose to use vscode, even though it is just an editor. As VS is too completed, the startup time is too long  and many functions are merely use. Thus, they prefer vscode, which can add plugins when we needed to reach the demand and enjoy a high speed.



doesn't:

- In the context of art. You need to perfect it as much as you can at first, and when you release it,you can't modify it anymore.
- In the context of building airplanes, buses or so cars ... It needs integral and detailed creation to guarantee the safety of the passenger.



### Please describe one of your own projects, and think whether “worse is better” is suitable for it.

It seems really appropriate for my own project. As I work on a project, I usually start from a prototype then grow it up for other functions. I need to divided my project to several modules and work one each of them orderly.
